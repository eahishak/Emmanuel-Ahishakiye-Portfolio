            <h2>The Formula of Life</h2>
            <p>It was in the twilight, I was walking upstairs when my mom called me,<br> she told me that I was moving  like a definition of life. </br>I was confused and couldn’t really get what she wanted to mean.  </br>
            I kept asking myself what’s the formula of life.</p>
            <div id="poem1" style="display: none;">
                <p>Life is an opportunity to  achieve what you want, </br>
                    It doesn’t matter where you were nurtured </br>
                    It matters to the love you give, </br>
                    Not the hate you give, </br>
                    Look up to grab the forth </br>
                    And How you can define this mystery. </br> </br>
                    
                    We go up and downs, </br>
                    We lose and gain </br>
                    And we create what we get </br>
                    The life we live is determined by our preference </br>
                    But it doesn’t mean that  </br>
                    We’re all set </br> </br>
                    
                    “How to build a life” is a new column that aims to give you the tools you need to construct a life that feels whole and meaningful, said Arthur Brooks in 2017. </br>
                    
                    After a while, you learn </br>
                    The subtle difference between </br>
                    Holding a hand and chaining a soul </br>
                    And you learn that life doesn’t mean leaning </br>
                    It doesn’t mean that the path is always smooth. </br>
                    But creating it.  </br> </br>
                    
                    
                    I could feel the strong love in my veins </br>
                    N’ lifting up my weight  </br>
                    Lik’ a sunset on the top of hill shining </br>
                    The kisses aren’t really contracts </br>
                    But the way I treat my beloved ones </br> </br>
                    
                    R’ Spinning my manners </br>
                    And mixing up words </br>
                    All make me dizzy </br>
                    That’s the ocean I swim </br>
                    Good and bad, </br> </br>
                    
                    
                    It’s  always in the hideout  </br>
                    drifting in every single corner </br>
                    Nobody around to lift and get me water </br>
                    I am exposed  Because I still want honor  </br>
                    Like a doyen in hammer </br>
                    I keep nodding with a little smile  </br>
                    Why ain’t I getting the formula. </br> </br>
                    
                    The power of love, grit  </br>
                    And growth mindset  </br>
                    No messy, just </br>
                    Doing what is right  </br>
                    
                    Being yourself and loving yourself </br>
                    The community is again the priority </br>
                    Just keep serving with the heart of gratitude </br>
                    That’s the formula of life. </br></br>

            <h2> Little Choices</h2>
            <p> A: Every early morning waking up thinking of you<br>
B. Okay. Fun of you hhh. eehee<br>
A: I keep on following you!<br>
B: Ah. I also keep on following you!<br>
A: Women are trash.<br>
B: Men are trash.<br>
A: Why Do I even keep on Running after you? Love is blind.<br>
B: Okay: Leave me alone; Love is not blind.<br><br>

B: It was your choice.

                <p>
                    A: Of course. Then  I never regret<br>
                    A: And you know how much I care about you<br>
                    B: You also know how much I think of you<br>
                    A/B: Let’s leave it<br><br>
                    
                    A/B: 
                    That’s how we live<br><br>
                    
                    A: Life is Razzmatazz<br>
                    But rigmarolling<br>
                    Where future seems unturned and clear<br>
                    And skies are seen in blur mode for some folks<br>
                    And view no success in the beautiful goals we have<br>
                    And that’s okay<br><br>
                    
                    B: There is always a step to take<br><br>
                    
                    A: We are defined by what and who we show people we are<br>
                    But bad enough, we are not given real definitions<br>
                    Coz’ we chose material possessions<br><br>
                    
                    B: Indeed, Now we go <br>
                    I think it’s a compelling choice<br><br>
                    
                    B: Just grasp  that loud voice but catchy<br>
                    And Say “Never be pretentious”<br><br>
                    
                    A/B:
                    Life isn’t the way we think it is<br>
                    Climbing the tumble-like hill to the top<br>
                    And it’s like little birds in the mystery <br>
                    With mistakes of misery<br>
                    But relearned the actions of bravery<br><br>
                    
                    A: That makes sense then.<br>
                    It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
                    How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
                    I am the master of my fate,<br>
                    I am the captain of my soul.<br><br>
                    
                    B: The best gift to have is love but not a material one<br><br>
                    
                    A: But the best treasure to own is  embedded in kindness and fidelity<br><br>
                    
                    B: Anyway do you remember to rethink before you chose<br>
                    R’ do you remember to pray before you chose<br>
                    That reflects the determination of our little choices<br><br>
                    
                    
                    A: I go on the way <br>
                    Out of the night that covers me,<br>
                    Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>
                    I thank whatever gods may be<br>
                    For my unconquerable soul.<br><br>
                    and,<br><br>
                    B:  you just say <br>
                    I have been told lies in that life,<br>
                    Standing on the top of mountains distracted  <br>
                    Moving around and dancing in their matters and of course, <br>
                    A: I was steaming and bombed in a fancy way<br>
                    Raising my hands in the air but holding nothing special<br><br>
                    
                    B: Don’t just blame things that don’t work out<br>
                    And say that chances didn’t turn out<br><br>
                    
                    A: Coz’ you messed up on your wanded- sledge<br>
                    When you wanted to make it out<br>
                    B: With your wrong choices to turn them out<br>
                    Shame on you<br><br><br>
                    
                    A: I told you to leave me alone<br>
                    Coz’ now I know the right track<br>
                    The sky is not the limit<br>
                    Just look into my hazel eyes and <br>
                    Read aloud that formula<br>
                    C=E<br><br>
                    
                    B: And that’s how I feel loved. hhhhh<br><br>
                    
                    A: Good for you.<br><br>
                    
                    A: You have many followers<br>
                    You know that everyone is counting on you<br>
                    For you to be the light of your generation<br>
                     and your future begotten ones<br><br>
                    
                    B: The same to you<br><br>
                    
                    A: I remember<br><br>
                    
                    A/B:
                    We got out a bit and opened our eyes to see you<br>
                    We came down hills as we’re discerning you up the hills<br>
                    We ran breathlessly to set foot on your spot<br><br>
                    
                    B: Stars started shining by the time<br>
                    And we lived again.<br><br>
                    
                    A: That was the meliora choice we ever made<br><br>
                    
                    
                    A/B:
                     “Ever better”<br>
                    The choices are in your hands<br>
                    Mind  your little choices<br><br>

            <h2>A Strange Trashed Broken Heart</h2>
            <p>
                In the afternoon, I, waking up after a long nap</br>
                I found myself in a mystery</br>
                With no definition of  the skies</br>
                Only feeling tied with dreams of whys</br>
                Contours on my face, ooh My God,</br>
                In the confrontation of your lies and cries</br>
                Because of my strange trashed broken heart</p>

                <p>
                    People would always call me a man</br>
                    Cause they always saw me in pants</br>
                    And that’s why I sent my men</br>
                    With unturned fame,</br>
                    You told them</br>
                    I’m lik’ a broken glass</br>
                    I am nothing infront of you.</br></br>
                    
                    Testify, stop killin it, Go</br></br>
                    
                    
                    
                    B. 
                    Stop talkin’</br>
                    Cool down, </br>
                    You’re a little broken bird with no land, no home, no love</br>
                    I’ve seen men, not like you</br>
                    A man with no stamina, no culture</br>
                    A man of confusion</br>
                    You have no room in my hood of heart</br>
                    Only boom of the bell of your tongue</br></br>
                    
                    A.
                    From Monday, Tuesday, the whole week</br>
                    We used to smile in pacificatin,</br>
                    But you multiplied all that feelings with minus</br>
                    Calling me onus</br>
                    Reminding me of what happened in the past</br></br>
                    
                    That I couldn’t speak french and say “Je t'aime”</br>
                    Not for you but for my first crash</br>
                    Spanish, “Adios” all became my burden</br>
                    In my life, despair, all I faced</br>
                    Coz you remained my lurden burden especially when we;re in London</br></br>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    B. 
                    I still freeze when I think of my friends whom we loved and lost </br>
                    In Dubai, when I was giving you that frozen flower in the last floor of the towel Burj Khalifa</br>
                    For I was not able to break the glass with my arabic voice of “hararahum”, Free them.</br>
                    But you don’t even take a glimpse of that, hoomie</br>
                    Forcing me to call you honey when</br>
                    Nobody was around to escot me in that journey</br>
                    Because I minded only my hometown language and shumi[Japanesse:hobby].</br></br>
                    
                    
                    A.
                    I still don’t blame you</br>
                    I only knew one language,</br>
                    But I always kept with the hymn of the harmony of Pablo,</br>
                    If each day a flower</br>
                    climbs up to your lips to seek me,</br>
                    ah my love, ah my own,</br>
                    in me all that fire is repeated,</br>
                    in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,</br>
                    my love feeds on your love, beloved,</br>
                    and as long as you live it will be in your arms</br>
                    without leaving mine.</br>
                    And you never cared. Only calling me a trash</br></br>
                    
                    
                    B. 
                    It’s not only language barrier,</br>
                    You crashed on me and started making me your heart carrier</br>
                    Coz you had no culture,</br>
                    But day by the day I kept on learning and loving</br>
                    With the wounds of your shots and my own failures</br>
                    I still have a reason to live</br>
                    Swahili, hujambo is no longer a problem,</br>
                    Kinyarwanda, mwaramutse is neither</br></br>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    A.  You loved my flows when I started rapping  </br>

                    Ahuuuui,</br>
                    Even our almighty God has put a mark on it.</br></br>
                    
                     
                    Oh my soul, breathe, breathe. </br>
                    Hungeri</br>
                    There is yet joy for us this late day.</br>
                    Clasp my hand harder if you will</br>
                    Tell me I haven’t mislaid my mind.</br>
                    The ecstasy of first love pulses still.</br>
                    Peace and passion we can yet find.</br></br>
                    
                    Come walk with me in the misty rain</br>
                    And mend what was to what will be.</br>
                    Each kissing droplet cleanses the stain</br>
                    Nurturing a new life for you and me.</br>
                    And forget the history of a strange broken heart but only a tame love.</br></br>
                    
                    B.
                    Now we can speak, travel, and  interact with our beloved ones </br></br>
                    A.
                    Spread love and peace. </br>

            <h2>A Letter: An Excellent Hero</h2>
            <p>Dear Son,</br></br>

                It started like a movie, </br>
                But nobody could tell</br>
                I was sophisticated,</br>
                but nobody could apprise</br>
                I called it a friendship </br>
                but with pretentiousness
               </p>
           
            <div id="poem4" style="display: none;">
                <p>
                    We looked insane</br>
                    We didn’t know that one day we would climb</br>
                    It was very confusing in that misery game</br>
                    Being mystified and stepped on by that matter</br>
                    And when he ran holding my hands</br>
                    I couldn’t notice</br></br>
                    
                    It seemed boring in that twilight </br>
                    With no hope of gazing at the sunrise</br>
                    We only had feelings of disgust and love at the same time</br>
                    Haha, Very confusing,</br>
                    And we weren’t really worried coz’</br>
                    That was the instant mood and our daily food</br></br>
                    
                    I kinda motivated myself by saying it’s okay not to be okay</br>
                    Nevertheless, Living in that calamity</br>
                    Looking in the sky and </br>
                    Seeing no stars except blowing wind</br>
                    But what did I do after the miles I ran?</br>
                    You see! </br>
                    NO Choice</br></br>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    While I was thinking about what to do next,</br>
                    It was very hard to think of luck</br>
                    Lik’ a sailor in the hurricane</br>
                    However, I heard some steps in distance heading up making noise</br>
                    In fact, I was still bamboozled coz’ my people were chanting in their resistance</br></br>
                    
                    One day, I moved to a new place,</br>
                    And that I called home</br>
                    I kept blinking my eyes</br>
                    Standing on the crest of the wave</br>
                    Enjoying the fest of the west</br>
                    Trying this test of love</br>
                    Coz’ I didn’t want to rest on that phase,</br>
                    And that’s where I gave birth to you</br></br>
                    
                    That was the real world of eagles,</br>
                    I thought you were saying,</br>
                    Mom, this algorithm is very tough</br>
                    I didn’t want to confess or laugh</br>
                    And of course, the way was not rough</br>
                    
                    No more haziness thought was a lie, haha</br>
                    Our hearts were full of happiness indeed</br>
                    Bumped away laziness and </br>
                    Had feelings of love</br>
                    That wonderful feeling that seemed to boggle our minds</br></br>
                    
                    They came across us after</br>
                    Sledging on our wand</br>
                    They took our shape because we were nurtured</br>
                    By the nature of the inspirational people</br></br>
                    Who taught us how to sing the songs of gratitude?</br>
                    And move in that special beat symbolizing sparrows</br>
                    Nicolas said</br>
                    A family is like a book.</br>
                    The ending's never clear,</br>
                    but through the pages of the book,</br>
                    their love is always near.</br>
                    
                    You still stand near us holding our hands</br>
                    For you never let us fall</br>
                    You're still an exceptional</br>
                    Coz’ you don’t wanna let yours strand like them</br>
                     You have the key,</br>
                    Change them until you reach the page</br>
                    Those stories will never change</br></br>

            <h2> The Heart Of Gratitude</h2>
            <p>Why ain’t I valued?</br>
                Is it because I am you?</br>
                Or is it that I have no money?</br>
                They keep being rude because</br>
                I am always in that hood of the mood</br>
                Can I live when my face is curved by the hoodie?</br>

                    I am drifted in every single corner</br>
                    Nobody around to lift and get me water</br>
                    I am exposed </br>
                    Because I still want honor </br>
                    Like a doyen in hammer</br>
                    I keep nodding with a little smile </br>
                    I want you to feel me, and </br>
                    Give me the ball on this floor.</br></br>
                    
                    Don’t stage it out </br>
                    licking lips like a baby</br>
                    Don’t lie coz’ I am still gentle</br> 
                    Like’ a gentle wind on the gentle slope of the jungle</br>
                    Stay humble and leave me alone </br>
                    Don’t give me a stone when I need a chrome</br>
                    My wand is tied with that rope </br>

                    I am tummy </br>
                    I need unity and honey</br>
                    I have pair but</br>

                    The plan is horning like a car    </br>
                    You’re to kick on but    </br>
                    You gotta go solo tomorrow  </br>  
                    Rush up, time is up    </br>  </br>
                    Take off the complications    </br>
                    Catch up the required    </br>
                    Prepare the possibilities    </br>

            <h2>The way forward</h2>
            <p>The way forward</br>
                I am still sleepy but<br>
                My eyes are clearly open<br>
                I go up and down<br>
                But I am still confused
              </p>
            
            <div id="poem8" style="display: none;">
               
                <p>   
                    The life is turning back<br>
                    All of my things have become black<br>
                    I am very stack<br>
                    I don’t have any work<br>
                    I still have the badge of bad luck.<br><br>
                     
                    I can see the river bank when I peep<br>
                    I am swifted and frazzled<br>
                    I whistle calling wisdom,<br>
                    But they wall is still ragging on the stand<br>
                    I still ain’t got  no freedom<br><br>
                     
                    I am aching the blowing wind<br>
                    Winding up my face<br>
                    I feel pain on my ankle<br>
                    And I keep asking myself<br>
                    Is it because I don’t have an uncle?<br><br>
                    How I am I gonna move forward?<br><br>
                     
                    I could hear nobody in the field<br>
                    Coz’ they all left me in the film<br>
                    I trim every part of the time<br>
                    That’s my rhythm but,<br>
                    God, Is this my stamina?<br><br>
                     
                    I reel the ray<br>
                    Lik’ the spinning wheel on the way<br>
                    I pray everyday<br>
                    Holding my hands as a little boy<br>
                    Ragging the way forward.<br>
